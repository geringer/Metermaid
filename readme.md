This is a project dedicated to analyzing a dataset of parking 
citations by the Parklink administartion in Raleigh, NC. The 
information was provided under the Freedom of Information Act 
as an Excel Spreadsheet. 

As a student and a resident of Boylan Heights, I find myself
always at odds with the parking enforcement. this is my attempt 
to outsmart them by vizualizitng their walking routes and 
attempting a time series analysis on the data to predict their 
paths of destruction.
